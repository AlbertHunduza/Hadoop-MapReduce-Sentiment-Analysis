Also pricing differs from shop to private shop.
-1: Don't get how Nvidia should release a card upon the retailer's and take pre orders of not give a date... Like, tossing that much money to possibly people waiting the year or two is horrible and that's only on the 3070 who mind 3080/3090. Also billing differs from shop to shop.
